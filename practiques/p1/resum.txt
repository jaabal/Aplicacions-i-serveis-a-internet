Create a container:
$sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n mycontainer


Start a container:
$sudo lxc-start -n mycontainer


Stop a container:
$sudo lxc-stop -nmycontainer


Check status:
$sudo lxc-ls --fancy


Connect to the container:
lxc-attach -n my-container
lxc-console -n my-container
ssh username@ipmy-container


Configuring static IP:

Location of the saved containers:
/var/lib/lxc/mycontainer


inside file config of any container: /var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config

We add:

#aja configuration
lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.105/24 10.0.3.255
lxc.network.ipv4.gateway = auto

#lxc.start.auto = 1
#lxc.start.delay = 15
#lxc.start.order = 10


Now we have an static IP by default, but the DHCP is also providing us
a dinamic IP. So we need to disable the auto DHCP in order to just get only 1 known static IP

For doing that we need to go to the machine. Inside the machine
we need to go to /etc/network/interfaces and comment the following line.

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp
---------------------


Now, we can communicate between the root system and the containers.
The containers only have an IP address but they don't have any 
interface to connect with Internet. In fact, they won't have never
an interface which provide them Ethernet connection, so we need to 
provide them internet using the mother PC. If we look at the communication
internet interfaces we will see that the containers have an interface
called eth0 which is mainly configured for an Ethernet connection. This interface
is not connected to the eth0 interface of the mother PC, although they have the same
name. One option would be to configure our ethernet mother PC for stablishing an interface
using the eth0 interface. This is a big error because we need to take in consideration that
eth0 of the mother PC is reserved for the physical Ethernet of the PC, which is the one who
provides internet to the PC. 

So, we have a problem. The ethernet comes from an interface which is already prepared for 
getting the Ethernet connectivity, so until here we are fine. We have a mother PC which has
an interface from where we receive Internet. Now we need to send this Internet to our containers,
but we cannot extend the eth0 interface. So, we need to create a "new" interface but using the eth0
interface. this can sound a bit strange but we are talking about creating a path to connect the eth0
of your mother PC with the eth0 of the containers. This "new" interface is mainly known as a bridge.

A bridge is like a translator between different interfaces in order to interconnect these interfaces.
Without a bridge we would be joining two interfaces, converting them into 1. The idea is to have two 
different interfaces which they can talk between them but they are completely different interfaces.

Now we will configure our bridge:
